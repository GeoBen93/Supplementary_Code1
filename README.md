# Supplementary_Code1
Supplementary Code 1 of Clarke et al. 2019. Model of the cooling of a spherically symmetric, foamy pyroclasts during flight assuming forced convection and radiation at the outer boundary. 

Code written by Nayor and Clarke to describe the rate at which a foamy pyroclast cools as it flys through the air. The results derived from this code are described in detail in Clarke et al. 2019. The code is written in Python 3 and presented in a Jupyter Notebook.
